Cycle Detection

Some older workflows contain mistakes where steps end up depending on each other in a round-and-round loop. When this happens, the system gets stuck and can’t move forward.

To prevent this, we added a smart check that detects these loops before they cause problems.

Real-World Example

Imagine three coworkers:

Alice needs Bob’s key

Bob needs Carol’s key

Carol needs Alice’s key

Everyone is waiting for someone else, and no one can open the door.
That’s what a circular dependency looks like in a workflow  everything is blocked.

Our validator now catches this situation early and stops the workflow from being loaded.

How the tool detects it (in simple terms)

We use a method similar to two people walking around a track:

One walks slowly

One walks faster

If the fast person eventually catches the slow person, they must be walking in a circle

This helps us identify loops quickly and safely.

Why this is important

It prevents system crashes

It keeps bad or broken workflows out of the database

It gives clear error messages, so it’s easier to fix the data

This makes the entire migration process more reliable and much easier to maintain.
