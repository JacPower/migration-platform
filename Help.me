Cycle Detection – Simple Explanation

Some older workflows have steps that accidentally point back to each other in a loop.
Example:
Step A waits for Step B → Step B waits for Step C → Step C waits for Step A again.
This creates an endless loop, and the system gets stuck.

To detect this, we used a very lightweight method similar to two people walking around a track:

One person walks at normal speed

The other walks faster

If the faster person eventually catches up, it means they are walking in a circle

We apply the same idea to workflow steps.
If our “fast walker” catches the “slow walker,” we know there is a loop in the workflow, and we stop the import with a clear error message.

Why it’s good

Quick – It checks the entire workflow very fast.

Safe – It doesn’t use extra memory or heavy processing.

Clear errors – Instead of crashing, we now tell the user exactly what went wrong.

This ensures that bad or corrupted workflows never reach the database and prevents future system crashes.
